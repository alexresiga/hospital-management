#### catching a cold has never been easier
The application will be used in order to manage the data of a hospital. Users will have different roles: doctors, nurses and patients. Based on their roles the users will be able to do the following actions:
- doctor:
  - see the list of patients with their medical profiles
  - create medical letters/prescriptions
  - see his appointments
  - approve/decline new appointments
- nurse:
  - see the list of patients with their medical profiles
  - share the medications to the patients
- patient:
  - see his medical letters/prescriptions
  - see his appointments
  - create an appointment
  - cabinet schedules
  - see his medical profile
 
For a doctor it is known the personal data, department, years of experience and medical specialization; for a nurse: personal data, department and principal duties and for a patient: personal data, medical history.
Our app should enhance the communication between patients and medical personnel and ease their access to the medical system.
